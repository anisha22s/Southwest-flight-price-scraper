# *Southwest Airlines Flight Price Tracker*

This project involves collecting flight price data for four major different routes operated by Southwest Airlines: San Francisco to Las Vegas, San Francisco to Boston, San Francisco to Miami, and San Francisco to Los Angeles. In order to remain competitive in the market, Southwest Airlines must constantly monitor and adjust its pricing strategies. To support this effort, we used web-scraping techniques to collect flight price data for Southwest Airlines and structured it for easy access and data analysis.

## *Getting Started*

To use this project, you will need to install the following tools:

Python 3.6 or higher
Beautiful Soup library
Selenium web driver
MongoDB
Once you have installed these tools, you can clone this repository and run the main.py file to start scraping data.

## *How it Works*

We used Selenium, a powerful web-scraping tool, to automate browsing the web and extracting data from Southwest Airlines' website. We then used Beautiful Soup library in Python to parse the data, which allowed us to extract specific data elements from the web pages. The data was stored in a MongoDB database, which was chosen due to its flexible querying which allows us to easily compare pricing trends across the four different routes. The dataset includes web-scraping time, the date, the price, and the route, and is sorted in time series order for easier observation.
